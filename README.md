# Immune System Simulation 🦠🛡️

👋 Welcome to the Immune System Simulation! This project is an interactive, visual simulation of how immune cells defend the body against bacterial invasions. Built with React and Vite, it uses emojis and a dynamic grid to create an engaging and educational experience.

---

## Features 🌟

- **Realistic Immune Cell Behaviors** 🛡️⚔️🎯: Watch macrophages chase and eliminate bacteria, T-cells heal infected areas, and B-cells mark invaders for attack.
- **Dynamic Grid System** 🗺️: A non-wrapping grid mimics biological boundaries for a realistic simulation environment.
- **Interactive Controls** 🕹️: Start, pause, reset, or manually add bacteria and immune cells to experiment with different scenarios.
- **Visual Feedback** 👀: Emojis represent cell types and states, making the simulation intuitive and fun to explore.
- **Responsive Design** 📱💻: Enjoy a seamless experience across various screen sizes and devices.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/izuc/immune-system-sim.git
   cd immune-system-sim
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** 📦:
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server** 🚀:
   Launch the simulation with:

## Usage 🎮

Once the simulation is running, here’s how to interact with it:

- **Start/Pause** ▶️⏸️: Click "Start" to begin the simulation or "Pause" to halt it.
- **Add Bacteria** 🦠: Click "Add Bacteria" to introduce new invaders to the grid.
- **Add Immune Cells** 🛡️: Use "Add Immune Cell" to deploy more defenders.
- **Reset** 🔄: Hit "Reset" to return to the initial state.
- **Observe** 👀: See how immune cells dynamically respond to bacteria in real-time.
